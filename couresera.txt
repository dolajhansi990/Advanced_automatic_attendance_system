question-1:

I’m a student from India and want to learn Data Science. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into a good firm as an intern. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate for this course. I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such an amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in the future. Sir, we are three brothers and we all are at the learning stage it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for all three of us and if I add up my course it will make it even harder for them to pay. Sir, I need this course very badly for my CV and for increasing my knowledge about the subject.
